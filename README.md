# Edx Portfolio Project

## Description

This challenge had us create a portfolio using our css knowledge. We did not utilise any frameworks or web API's for this challenge. It was a lot of fun and I learnt a lot about grid that I didn't know before. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
